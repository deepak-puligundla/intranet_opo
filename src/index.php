      <h2>Community Service at Work!</h2>
      <p>
        <b>Ween Dream:</b> They are a non-profit organization that deals solely with getting disadvantaged youth your gently used Halloween costumes.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have any gently used Halloween costumes that you or your kids might outgrow by next year, take a look at these instructions and think about sending them to 'Ween Dream!
      </p>
      <p>
        Here are the instructions for donations:
        <ol>
          <li>Wash or dry clean (depending on the costume's care instructions) each costume before donating it to 'WEEN DREAM. We are unable to use costumes that have not been cleaned.</li>
          <li>Only donate costumes that are in good condition. As a rule of thumb, if you would purchase the costume in its current condition from a consignment shop for your own child, then it's probably in "good" condition.</li>
          <li>Put each costume in its own large, sealed Ziploc bag so that it will not get wet or dirty while it is waiting to be processed by our volunteers. </li>
          <li>Write the following information on a piece of paper and slide it in the bag with the costume:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Type of Costume (such as character name or general description, like "Princess");</li>
            <li>Gender (Boy, Girl, or Unisex);</li>
            <li>Size (Toddler/Child/Teen S, M, L, XL, or numeric size); and</li>
            <li>Age (approximate) the costume is appropriate for.</li>
            <li>Getting the costume to 'WEEN DREAM:</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Costumes may be mailed from anywhere in America to our New Orleans headquarters at: <p>
            <b>'WEEN DREAM
            3001 River Rd.
            Jefferson, LA 70121 </b>
          </p></li>
          <li>New costumes (never worn and still in their original packaging) may be donated to 'WEEN DREAM in the same manner as described above for gently used costumes.</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
